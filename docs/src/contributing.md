`wasmsh` is an open-source prototype, and we welcome contributions from the community!

## How to Contribute

- **Report bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
- **Suggest features:** Have an idea for a new feature? Let us know by opening an issue.
- **Write code:** If you're a Rust developer, we'd love for you to contribute code. Feel free to pick up an open issue or submit a pull request.

## Development

To get started with development, you'll need to have the Rust toolchain installed. See the [Installation](installation.md) guide for more details.

We use `mdbook` for our documentation. To work on the docs, you'll need to install it:
```sh
cargo install mdbook
```
Then, you can serve the book locally:
```sh
mdbook serve docs
```
